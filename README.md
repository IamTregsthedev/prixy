# Prixy (Plugin)

  This repo/site was made to make https://api.scratch.mit.edu/proxy/featured look better on a 3rd party safe website, for scratch users, who can't login to scratch, but can see this, or users who want a cleaner way than the white plain scratch background.
  
 This Repo Was Possible to many People who posted pull requests and commits, and helped me. Thank you :D :).
